# Value-Investor-Tool

*This program is a work in progress. It is built in Python and uses Selenium to scrape data from NASDAQ. The web scraping will be done with responsibility in mind to avoid sending too many requests at once to the NASDAQ website. I will likely implement a sleep timer to do steps incrementally rather than all at once.*

This tool is meant to aid a value investor in assessing a stock. 

**This tool is not to be used to pick stocks for you. You are responsible for your own research on a particular stock. This tool simply aids your research, rather than
replaces the research you have to do on a particular stock. I am not a financial analyst, nor do I promise that you will make money using this tool.
Please use this tool at your own discretion, and do not solely rely on it to make a financial decision.**
